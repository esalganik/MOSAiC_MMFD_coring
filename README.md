A forcing dataset for single column model based on MOSAiC first- and second-year ice coring data

The dataset covers observations from 29 Oct 2019 to 29 July 2020.
Vertical spatial resolution is 0.05 m, and temporal resolution is 6 h.
The dataset provides sea-ice salinity, temperature, brine volume, and density data.
