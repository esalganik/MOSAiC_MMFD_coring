* A forcing dataset for single column model based on MOSAiC first-year ice coring data

The dataset covers observations from 29 Oct 2019 to 29 July 2020.
Vertical spatial resolution is 0.05 m, and temporal resolution is 6 h.
The dataset provides sea-ice salinity, temperature, brine volume, and density data.
The temperature was measured by ice mass balance buoys 2019T66: https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.938134
Salinity and density was measured by ice coring: https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.971385
