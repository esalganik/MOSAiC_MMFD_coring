* A forcing dataset for single column model based on MOSAiC first-year ice coring data

The dataset covers 29 Oct 2019 - 29 July 2020.
Vertical spatial resolution is 0.05 m, and temporal resolution is 6 h.
The dataset provides data on sea-ice salinity, temperature, and brine volume.
The temperature was measured by ice mass balance buoys 2019T66: https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.938134
Salinity was measured by ice coring: https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.971385
